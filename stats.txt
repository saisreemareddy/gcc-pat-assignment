(output_decl):  Call `output_tagged_type_instantiation'.
Don't generate a pubnames label for anything marked as DECL_ABSTRACT.
(output_die):  Generate the proper kind fo DIE for each of the four
possible combination of {normal, inlined} {variable, parameter}.

actual type for any FIELD_DECL.  Also, use `simple_type_size_in_bits'
to avoid potential problems with ERROR_MARKs when computing the size
of a FIELD_DECL.
(bit_offset_attribute):  Rewritten to use `field_byte_offset' when
determining the start of the "containing object".

Major rework to have caller-saves emit load/store double insns when...

	Major rework to have caller-saves emit load/store double insns when
	possible and to avoid useless resaving of registers restored for
	source accesses only.
	* caller-save.c (toplevel): All arrays are multi-dimensional to
	hold information for multiple save/restore insns.  New variable
	hard_regs_need_restore.
	(choose_hard_reg_mode): New argument `nregs' indicating how many
	hard registers are desired.  All callers changed.
	(init_caller_save): Change initialization to handle multiple
	register saves.  A call-used register can not be live across
	if we can not find a single register mode to save it in.
	(multiple register saves are optional)
	(init_save_areas): Change initialization of regno_save_mem to
	handle multiple register saves.
	(setup_save_areas): Allocate space for consecutive hard registers
	in aligned consecutive memory locations.   When allocating space
	for consecutive hard registers, also initialize regno_save_mem
	for each hard register stored as a single word.
	(save_call_clobbered_regs): Initialize hard_regs_need_restore.
	Set hard_regs_need_restore to hard_regs_saved after crossing
	a call.  Also recompute n_regs_saved.  At the end of a basic block
	we need only restore registers in hard_regs_need_restore.
	(set_reg_live, clear_reg_live): Do the right thing for
	hard_regs_need_restore and hard_regs_saved.
	(restore_referenced_regs): Just return if X is a clobber.
	Test hard_regs_need_restore to determine when to restore a hard
	register from the save area.
	(insert_save_restore): Now returns the number of extra registers
	saved/restored.  New argument `maxrestore' which constrains how
	many hard registers should be restored.  All callers changed.
	Do stores of consecutive registers with double store insns if
	possible.  Else do them with single word insns. Likewise for
	loads, except constrained by maxrestore.  Set hard_regs_saved
	and hard_regs_need_restore appropriately to minimize useless
	saves into the save area.  Test against	hard_regs_need_restore
	when trying to restore multiple regs and similarly test against
	hard_regs_saved when storing multiple regs.

config.sub: Added machines and operating systems for Emacs ports...

Fri Nov 20 05:24:16 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* config.sub: Added machines and operating systems for Emacs
	ports, since Emacs now uses config.sub for its configuration.
	New manufacturers recognized not to be operating systems: High
	Level Hardware (highlevel, defaults to using BSD), Gould
	(gould, defaults to System V), Commodore (cbm, defaults to
	amigados), National Semiconductor (ns, defaults to Genix), and
	Masscomp (masscomp, defaults to RTU).
	Recognize the NS1600 (ns16k) and the Clipper (clipper) as
	processors.
	Recognize these processors with default manufacturers: the
	Cydra (cydra) from Cydrome (cydrome), the XPS100 (xps100) from
	Honeywell (honeywell), and the Orion (orion) and Orion 1/05
	(orion105) from High Level Hardware (highlevel).
	If the ISC operating system is given with a version number,
	don't kill it and set it to 2.2; just have it default to 2.2
	if omitted.
	Make Irix SGI's default operating system, not SYSV.
	Make BSD Encore's default, so it applies for all Encore
	machines, not just the umax and mmax abbreviations.
	All of Encore's machines use BSD, not just the ns32k-based
	ones.  Make it the manufacturer's default.
	Make it possible to specify an operating system for a Gould
	machine.  Make sysv the manufacturer's default, so it applies
	when we specify the manufacturer as well as when we omit it.
	Add Uniplus (uniplus), Iris (iris), Xenix (xenix), and RTU
	(rtu) as recognized operating system names.

reloads, refine when we may not make in-out optional reloads, and make an
optional reload for a pair of matching operands.

When setting up tm.h, convert "vax/vax.h" into "config-vax.h" rather
than "[.config.vax]vax.h" for #include so it will work from [.cp]
subdirectory; copy vax.h to config-vax.h as part of configuration

compilers (a temporary measure; it should process cp/Makefile.in like
it does for primary makefile).

(getenv, index, rindex): Don't declare explicitly if the appropriate system
eader should declare it.

directive-handler's types match.
(do_sccs): Define only if SCCS_DIRECTIVE is defined.

(add_constant, dump_table, fixit, find_barrier, broken_move): New
support functions for handling constant spilling.
(arm_reorg): New constant spilling pass, for putting unhandlable
constants into the rtl where we can load them efficiently.
(output_load_symbol): Delete.
(strings_fpa): Use a form which is common to both GAS and ARMASM.
(output_return_instruction, output_func_epilogue): Call
assemble_external_libcall, before trying to generate an abort call
in the assembler.
	(arm_asm_output_label): Call ARM_OUTPUT_LABEL, rather than assuming
that labels are followed by a colon.

for an architecture 4 target.  The offsets for floating point
constants are the same as for integers if compiling TARGET_SOFT_FLOAT
(GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS): Don't allow PRE_INC and POST_DEC if
the size is more than 4 bytes.  Restrict the range offsets for DImode;
likewise for DFmode when TARGET_SOFT_FLOAT.

to determine if a constant address might be better in a register.
Handle DFmode addresses in the same way as DImode if TARGET_SOFT_FLOAT.
(LOAD_EXTEND_OP): If arm_arch4, then HImode also zero-extends.
(SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS): No need to handle floating
point constants any more, since arm_reorg will deal with them.
(LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P): Is now anything that doesn't contain a
LABEL.
(GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS): Recognize addresses expressions generated
by arm_reorg, but only after reload has completed.
(MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG): Define.
(ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY): There should be nothing left in
the pool, even if it might look like it.

(CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P): Can't directly access constant strings when
	generating assembler for ARMASM.
(ENCODE_SECTION_INFO): Don't define if generating ARMASM assembler.
(ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL): Generalize, so that it can be used
with all targeted assemblers.

Try harder not to open or stat the same include file twice.

Simplify include file names so that they are more likely to match.
E.g. simplify "./a//b" to "a/b".  Represent directories with simplified
prefixes, e.g. replace "./a//b" with "a/b/", and "." with "".

(absolute_filename): New function.
(do_include): Use it.
(read_name_map): Likewise; this makes things more consistent for DOS.

(main, do_include, open_include_file): -M output now contains operands
of -imacros and -include.

(skip_to_end_of_comment): When copying a // comment, don't try to
change it to a /* comment.
(rescan, skip_if_group, skip_to_end_of_comment, macarg1): Tune.

(rescan, skip_if_group, skip_to_end_of_comment, macarg1):
If warn_comments is nonzero, warn if backslash-newline appears
in a // comment.  Simplify method for finding /* /* */ comment.
(skip_if_group): Optionally warn if /* /* */ appears between # and
a directive inside a skipped if group.
(macarg): Optionally warn if /* /* */ appears in a macro argument.

(strncat, VMS_strncat, vms_ino_t, ino_t): Remove.
(INCLUDE_LEN_FUDGE): Add 2 if VMS, for trailing ".h".
(INO_T_EQ, INO_T_HASH): New macros.

(struct file_buf): New member `inc'.
(expand_to_temp_buffer): Initialize it.

(struct file_name_list): New member `inc'.
(struct file_name_list): New member `st'.
c_system_include_path is now 1 if not 0.
fname is now an array, not a pointer.
(struct include_file): New members `next_ino', `deps_output', `st'.
Remove members `inode' and `dev'; they are now in `st'.

(INCLUDE_HASHSIZE): Rename from INCLUDE_HASH_SIZE.
(include_hashtab): Rename from include_hash_table.
(include_ino_hashtab): New variable.

(main): Store file status in struct stat, not in long and int pieces.
Use base_name to strip prefixes from file names.
When printing directory prefixes, omit trailing / and print "" as ".".
Fatal error if the input file is a directory.
(main, path_include): Regularize operands of -include, -imacros,
-isystem, -iwithprefix, and -iwithprefixbefore.
Regularize default include directories.

(do_include):
Allocate dsp with alloca, since fname is now dynamically allocated.
Use -3 to represent a never-opened file descriptor.
Make copy of file name, and simplify the copy.
Use base_name to identify the end of fname's directory.
Do not prepend dir for "..." if it matches the search list's first dir.
open_include_file now subsumes redundant_include_p and lookup_import.
Use bypass_slot to remember when to skip directories when including
a file that has already been seen.
Instead of using 0 to represent the working directory, and ""
to represent a directory to be ignored, use "" for the former,
and assume the latter has been removed before we get here.
Assume the directory prefixes have already been simplified.
Report as errors all open failures other than ENOENT.
Fatal error if fstat fails.
Use new deps_output member to avoid printing dependencies twice.
(bypass_hashtab): New variable.

(do_include, open_control_file, record_control_macro): New convention:
control_macro is "" if the file was imported or had #pragma once.
(pragma_once_marker): Remove.

(redundant_include_p, include_hash, lookup_include, lookup_import,
add_import, file_size_and_mode): Remove; subsumed by open_include_file.
(skip_redundant_dir_prefix): Remove; subsumed by simplify_filename.

(is_system_include, read_name_map, remap_include_file):
Assume arg is a directory prefix.

(base_name, simplify_filename, remap_include_file,
lookup_ino_include, new_include_prefix): New functions.

(open_include_file): New arguments `importing' and `pinc'.
Move filename mapping into new remap_include_file function.
First try to find file by name in include_hashtab;
if that doesn't work, open and fstat it and try to find it
by inode and dev in include_ino_hashtab.

(finclude): Get file status from inc->st instead of invoking fstat.
Store inc into fp->inc so that record_control_macro doesn't
need to do a table lookup.
(finclude, record_control_macro): Accept struct include_file *
instead of char * to identify include file.  All callers changed.

(check_precompiled): Get file status from new argument `st'.

(do_pragma): Output at most one warning about #pragma implementation.
Always return 0 instead of returning garbage sometimes.
(do_pragma, hack_vms_include_specification):
Use base_name for consistency, and remove redundant code.

From Per Bothner:
Unify the 3 separate mechanisms for avoiding processing
of redundant include files: #import, #pragma once, and
redundant_include_p to use a single more efficient data structure.
(struct file_name_list):  Remove no-longer needed field control_macro.
(dont_repeat_files, all_include_files):  Remove, no longer used.
(struct import_file):  Renmed to struct include_file, moved earlier
in file, renamed field name to fname, and added control_macro field.
(pragma_once_marker):  New constant.
(import_hash_table):  Renamed to include_hash_table.
(import_hash):  Renamed to include_hash.
(IMPORT_HASH_SIZE):  Renamed to INCLUDE_HASH_SIZE.
(main, path_include):  Don't clear removed control_macro field.
(lookup_include):  New function - look up fname in include_hash_table.
(redundant_include_p):  Re-write to use lookup_include.
(lookup_import, record_control_macro):  Likewise.
(add_import):  Defer fstat to caller.  Combine two xmallocs into one.
(do_once):  Use pragma_once_marker in include_hash_table.
(do_pragma):  Re-implement to scan include_hash_table.
(do_include):  Use new lookup_include and add_import.

General code cleanup in the style of 1995-04-01 change.

Add prototypes for static functions.
Add parentheses suggested by `gcc -Wparentheses'.
Use `long' uniformly, instead of long, int, HOST_WIDE_INT mess.
(struct constant): Use `signedp' flag (with sign bit) instead of
`unsignedp' flag; it's a little more convenient.

(HAVE_STDLIB_H, STDC_HEADERS, LONG_MASK, __attribute__, PROTO,
VA_START, PRINTF_ALIST, PRINTF_DCL, PRINTF_PROTO, PRINTF_PROTO_1,
vfprintf, SIGNED, UNSIGNED): New symbols.
<stdlib.h>: Include if HAVE_STDLIB_H.
<string.h>: New include.
(HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT, HOST_WIDE_INT): Remove.
(yylex, yyerror, expression_value, parse_number,
initialize_random_junk): Now static.

(overflow_sum_sign): Renamed from possible_sum_sign, with an
extra arg SIGNEDP.
(parse_number): Inline strcmp when checking for "0x".
(yylex): Keep track of mask needed when decoding wide characters.
(parse_escape): New arg RESULT_MASK; use it instead of
assuming char width.
(yylex, parse_escape, parse_c_expression): Store all host
integers as long, not int or HOST_WIDE_INT.
(left_shift): No need to do signed left shifts separately.

These changes are for the test program (if TEST_EXP_READER):
(pedantic, traditional): Allocate storage.
(main): Set pedantic, traditional, yydebug depending on args.
(is_hor_space, warning, lookup): Change types and implementation
to match rest of program.
(pedwarn, check_assertion, xmalloc): New functions.

Thu Jul 11 10:12:50 1996  Jeffrey A Law  (law@cygnus.com)

        * h8300/h8300.c (shift_one): Emit tabs between opcode and
        operands to be consistent with the rest of the compiler.
        (rotate_one): Likewise.
        (shift_two, rotate_two): Define.
        (get_shift_alg): Accept new argument "assembler2_p" for
        rotate/shift by two insns.  All callers changed.  Rework
        to generate more efficient code on the H8/300, H8/300H, and
        H8/S.  Try to simplify somewhat.
        (emit_a_shift): Use shift-by-two insns when they're available.
        Emit tabs between opcode and operands to be consistent with
        the rest of the compiler.

* Integrate alias analysis changes from jfc@mit.edu
        * Makefile.in (OBJS): Add alias.o
        (alias.o): Add dependencies.
        * alias.c: New file.
        * sched.c: Remove alias analysis code.  It lives in alias.c now.
        (reg_last_uses_size): Declare.
        (sched_analyze_2): Add new arguments to true_dependence.
        (sched_analyze_insn): Use reg_last_uses_size instead of max_reg.
        (schedule_block): Initialize reg_last_uses_size.
        (schedule_insns): Always call init_alias_analysis.
        * calls.c (expand_call): Note calls to malloc, calloc, and realloc;
        mark return value from such functions as a pointer and keep track of
        them for alias analysis.  If a return value from a function is a
        pointer, mark it as such.
        * combine.c (distribute_notes): Handle REG_NOALIAS.
        * cse.c (struct write_data): Delete.  No longer needed.
        (invalidate): Don't call set_nonvarying_address_components anymore.
        Use true_dependence to decide if an entry should be removed from
        the hash table.
        (invalidate_memory): Remove WRITES argument, simplify appropriately.
        Fix all callers.
        (note_mem_written): Similarly for WRITE_PTR argument.
        (invalidate_from_clobbers): Similarly for W argument.

        cse_rtx_addr_varies_p.
        (cse_insn): Remove WRITES_MEMORY and INIT variables and all references.
        Don't call note_mem_written anymore.  Stack pushes invalidate the stack
        pointer if PUSH_ROUNDING is defined.  No longer need to call
        cse_rtx_addr_varies_p to decide if a MEM should be invalidated.
        (skipped_writes_memory): Remove variable.
        (invalidate_skipped_set): Simplify and wewrite to use invalidate_memory.
        (invalidate_skipped_block): Simplify for new alias analysis code.
        (cse_set_around_loop): Likewise.
        (cse_main): Call init_alias_analysis.
        * flags.h (flag_alias_check, flag_argument_noalias): Declare.
        * toplev.c (flag_alias_check, flag_argument_noalias): Define.
        (f_options): Add new alias checking arguments.

        * local_alloc (validate_equiv_mem_from_store): Add new arguments
        to true_dependence.
        (memref_referenced_p): Likewise.
        * loop.c (NUM_STORES): Increase to 30.
        (prescan_loop): Only non-constant calls set unknown_address_altered.
        (invariant_p): Add new arguments to true_dependence.
        (record_giv): Initialize unrolled and shared fields.
        (emit_iv_add_mult): Call record_base_value as needed.
        * loop.h (struct induction): Add unrolled and shared fields.
        * unroll.c  (unroll_loop): Call record_base_value as needed.
        (copy_loop_body): Likewise.
        (final_biv_value): Likewise.
        (final_giv_value): Likewise.
        (find_splittable_regs): Likewise.  Only create one new pseudo
        if we have multiple address GIVs that were combined with the same
        dst_reg GIV.  Note when a new register is created due to unrolling.
        * rtl.c (reg_note_name): Add REG_NOALIAS.
        * rtl.h (enum reg_note): Similarly.
        (rtx_varies_p, may_trap_p, side_effects_p): Declare.
